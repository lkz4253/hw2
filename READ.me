I created a fictional website advertising skincare products to allow people to create a 10 step skincare routine for themselves. 
The main page has a welcome message and a link to a YouTube tutorial on the 10 step skincare routine. 
It also has links to the products page and the team page. 
The products page has a list of products this fictional company has. The links to each product category is using a current skincare company's website.
The team page has introduction of myself as the fictional CEO and my sister as the fictional CMO.
